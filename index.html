            <h1><b>hey! i'm matthew :D</b></h1>
            <paragraph>I'm a current junior at UMD pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science and English, with a minor in Digital Storytelling and Poetics. 
                        I also work with <a href="https://english.umd.edu/writing-programs/writing-center">UMD's undergraduate Writing Center</a> and the 
                        <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)</a>, 
                        TA for a nonfiction writing class,
                        run the English department's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/umdaapi/">AAPI Literature and Media Club</a>, 
                        act as the treasurer of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swingdanceumd/">Swing Dance Club at UMD</a>, 
                        <a href="https://backloggd.com/u/guardizeph/">play</a> and (occasionally) <a href="https://matjgu.itch.io/">make</a> video games, 
                        and engage in a handful of other sidequests. 
                        After college, I'm interested in pursuing a graduate education that will prepare me for further study in the intersections between texts, technology, and composition. </paragraph>
