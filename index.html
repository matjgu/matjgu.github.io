    <h1><b>hey! i'm matthew.</b></h1>
    <paragraph>I'm a current junior at UMD pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science and English, with a minor in Digital Storytelling and Poetics. 
                I also work with UMD's Writing Center and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, TA for a nonfiction writing class,
                run the English department's AAPI Literature and Media Club, act as the treasurer of the Swing Dance Club at UMD, 
                play and (occasionally) make video games, and engage in a handful of other sidequests. After college, I'm interested in 
                pursuing a graduate education that will prepare me for research in the intersections between texts, technology, and composition. </paragraph>
